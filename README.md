# Lightweight Microservices .NET 5.0

This is a sample microservices application built with .NET 5.0, Docker, and Kubernetes. The application consists of multiple services that work together to provide a complete solution.

## Services

The application includes the following services:

1. Service 1: Description of Service 1.

2. Service 2: Description of Service 2.

3. Service 3: Description of Service 3.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following tools installed on your machine:

- .NET 5.0 SDK
- Docker
- Kubernetes (if you want to deploy to a Kubernetes cluster)

### Building the Services

To build the services, navigate to each service's directory and run the following command:

```
dotnet build
```

This will compile the services and generate the necessary artifacts.

### Running the Services Locally

To run the services locally, follow these steps:

1. Start the required infrastructure components (e.g., databases, message queues).

2. Navigate to each service's directory and run the following command:

```
dotnet run
```

Each service should now be running locally and ready to accept requests.

### Containerizing the Services

To containerize the services using Docker, use the following steps:

1. Navigate to each service's directory.

2. Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile:

```
docker build -t service-name .
```

Replace service-name with the actual name of the service.

Repeat the above steps for each service.

### Running the Services with Docker Compose

To run the services using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Docker is running on your machine.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.

3. Run the following command:

```
docker-compose
```

This will start all the services defined in the docker-compose.yml file.

### Deploying to Kubernetes

To deploy the services to a Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have a running Kubernetes cluster and the kubectl command-line tool configured to communicate with the cluster.

2. Navigate to each service's directory.

3. Apply the Kubernetes manifest using the following command:

```
kubectl apply -f service-name.yaml
```

Replace service-name.yaml with the actual YAML file for the service.

4. Repeat the above steps for each service.

### Testing the Services

To test the services, you can use tools like Postman or curl to send requests to the service endpoints. The endpoints and their descriptions can be found in the service's documentation.
